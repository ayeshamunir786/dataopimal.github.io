      A gerund is a verbal that ends in -ing and functions as a noun.<br> 
      The term verbal indicates that a gerund, like the other two kinds of verbals,<br>
      is based on a verb and therefore expresses action or a state of being. However,<br>
      since a gerund functions as a noun, it occupies some positions in a sentence tha<br>
      t a noun ordinarily would, for example: subject, direct object, subject complement,<br>
      and object of preposition.
